# AVDecisionLLM

🚗 **Autonomous Driving Decision System Powered by Large Language Models**

AVDecisionLLM is an innovative approach to autonomous vehicle decision-making that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex driving scenarios. This project transforms Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) sequential data into structured natural language representations, enabling LLMs to understand and reason about autonomous driving decisions through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning techniques.

## 🎯 Overview

Traditional autonomous driving systems rely heavily on rule-based decision-making and classical machine learning approaches. AVDecisionLLM introduces a paradigm shift by:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Converting complex V2X sensor data into human-readable text descriptions
- **LLM-Based Reasoning**: Utilizing the contextual understanding capabilities of large language models
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Combining spatial, temporal, and semantic information from autonomous vehicle scenarios
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implementing GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) for continuous improvement
